<h2  style= "font-family: calibri"> Declining Populations </h2>
  
<p> Over the last thirty years, mule deer populations in Nevada have experienced gradual decline. 
    The estimated population dropped from <b>250,000</b> in 1988 to <b> 68,000 </b> in 2023. 
    The Nevada Department of Wildlife suggests a few explanations for this saddening decline. 
    Harsh winters in recent years have prevented mule deer from receiving adequate nutrition thus reducing their chances of survival and producing viable offspring. 
    Additionally, this species is losing habitat at an unprecedented rate due to development and wildfire. 
    Without immediate action, the mule deer is likely to become an <em> “at risk” </em> species. </p>

<h2 style= "font-family: calibri"> What can be done? </h2>
<!-- expand on this section more -->
<p> The Nevada Department of wildlife suggests a <a href= "https://www.ndow.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/16B-CR-23-14-2023-2024-Recommended-Big-Game-Quotas-Memo-and-Language-1.pdf">40% reduction </a> in hunting tags, 
    dropping to <b> 10,783 </b> from their 2022 recommendation of <b> 15,210 </b>. 
    With less hunting, the species has a greater chance of producing offspring before the winter months. 
    Furthermore, the state has engaged in habitat restoration in hopes of returning destroyed scrubland to a food source for mule deer. </p>
